<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Daniel and this page will be a work in progress and learning experience rolled into one. I am always 
  seeking to improve myself and web design is a high demand skill that I am trying to learn. I like to think im pretty 
  tech savvy and I generally pick things up pretty quickly. I hope I can make good progress.</p>
<p>My journey to this point has been a long an winding one but I'm no stranger to hardship and would have it no other way. 
  Steel is hardened through work and heat, afterall. I know plenty of people have used the term "Learn to code" as a joke, 
often in response to a complaint about work or the state of the economy. I've taken that joke to heart and this is where I 
will be documenting that journey.</p>
<p>For me, this is a quest for independence and freedom.</p>
